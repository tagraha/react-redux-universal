## About

This starter kit for personal use as a playground

> NOTICE: Please read this important [issue](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-universally/issues/409) about the behaviour of this project when using `react-async-component`, which is by default bundled with it.

## Features

  - 👀 `react` as the view.
  - 🔀 `react-router` v4 as the router.
  - 🚄 `express` server.
  - 🎭 `jest` as the test framework.
  - 💄 Combines `prettier` and Airbnb's ESlint configuration - performing code formatting on commit. Stop worrying about code style consistency.
  - 🖌 Very basic CSS support - it's up to you to extend it with CSS Modules etc.
  - ✂️ Code splitting - easily define code split points in your source using `react-async-component`.
  - 🌍 Server Side Rendering.
  - 😎 Progressive Web Application ready, with offline support, via a Service Worker.
  - 🐘 Long term browser caching of assets with automated cache invalidation.
  - 📦 All source is bundled using Webpack v2.
  - 🚀 Full ES2017+ support - use the exact same JS syntax across the entire project. No more folder context switching! We also only use syntax that is stage-3 or later in the TC39 process.
  - 🔧 Centralised application configuration with helpers to avoid boilerplate in your code. Also has support for environment specific configuration files.
  - 🔥 Extreme live development - hot reloading of ALL changes to client/server source, with auto development server restarts when your application configuration changes.  All this with a high level of error tolerance and verbose logging to the console.
  - ⛑ SEO friendly - `react-helmet` provides control of the page title/meta/styles/scripts from within your components.
  - 🤖 Optimised Webpack builds via HappyPack and an auto generated Vendor DLL for smooth development experiences.
  - 🍃 Tree-shaking, courtesy of Webpack.
  - 👮 Security on the `express` server using `helmet` and `hpp`.
  - 🏜 Asset bundling support. e.g. images/fonts.
  - 🎛 Preconfigured to support development and optimised production builds.
  - ❤️ Preconfigured to deploy to `now` with a single command.
